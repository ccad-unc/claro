# What's Claro?

Claro is a set of cluster administration tools, that started as a fork of 
[clara](https://github.com/edf-hpc/clara/).  
Clara has created to help in the installation and maintenance of clusters 
at EDF (Electricit√© de France).

The different tools are written as independent plugins that can be added,
removed and modified independently. This plugins are compatibles with many GNU/Linux 
distributions, including Debian and RHEL derivatives.

Claro is distributed under the CeCILL-C Free Software License Agreement version
1.0. You can find more information about the CeCILL licenses at
[http://www.cecill.info/index.en.html](http://www.cecill.info/index.en.html).


# Obtaining, building and installing Claro

Claro's code is available at GitHub [https://github.com/ccad-unc/claro](https://github.com/ccad-unc/claro).
You can obtain a copy using *git*:

    $ git clone https://github.com/edf-hpc/claro.git

Claro is developed in a RHEL system, but probably also useful in a Debian or a Debian derivative
system. 

Claro provides a setuptools script for its installation.
Just run:

    # python setup.py install

Before, you also will need to install the runtime dependencies. 
The dependencies common to all plugins are:
[python](http://www.python.org), [docopt](http://docopt.org/) and [clustershell](http://cea-hpc.github.io/clustershell/).

The remaining dependencies, listed by plugin, are:

+ impi: [fping](http://fping.org/), [ipmitool](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ipmitool/), [sshpass](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sshpass/)


# Getting started

Claro itself is not a tool, but rather provides a common interface to several
tools. To see the list of available tools, just type `claro` like in the following
example.

    # claro
    Usage: claro [-d | -dd] [options] <plugin> [<args>...]
       claro help <plugin>
       claro [--version]
       claro [--help]

    Options:
       -d                 Enable debug output
       -dd                Enable debug output for third party applications
       --config=<file>    Provide a configuration file

    Claro provides the following plugins:
       ipmi     Manages and get the status from the nodes of a cluster.

    See 'claro help <plugin>' for detailed help on a plugin
    and 'claro <plugin> --help' for a quick list of options of a plugin.


Then to use the tool *ipmi*, just type `claro ipmi` and it'll show you the
options of *ipmi*:

     
    # claro ipmi
    Usage:
        claro ipmi connect [-jf] <host>
        claro ipmi getmac <hostlist>
        claro ipmi [--p=<level>] deconnect <hostlist>
        claro ipmi [--p=<level>] (on|off|reboot) <hostlist>
        claro ipmi [--p=<level>] status <hostlist>
        claro ipmi [--p=<level>] setpwd <hostlist>
        claro ipmi [--p=<level>] pxe <hostlist>
        claro ipmi [--p=<level>] disk <hostlist>
        claro ipmi [--p=<level>] ping <hostlist>
        claro ipmi [--p=<level>] blink <hostlist>
        claro ipmi [--p=<level>] immdhcp <hostlist>
        claro ipmi [--p=<level>] bios <hostlist>
        claro ipmi [--p=<level>] reset <hostlist>
        claro ipmi [--p=<level>] sellist <hostlist>
        claro ipmi [--p=<level>] selclear <hostlist>
        claro ipmi ssh <hostlist> <command>
        claro ipmi -h | --help

You can check quickly the help of the tool *ipmi* invoking the manpage:
`man claro-ipmi` or just typing `claro help ipmi`.

# Configuration file

The configuration file of Claro is installed at `/etc/claro/config.ini` and it
is a simple text file using the [INI file format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file).
This file has a basic structure composed of sections, properties, and values.
For example, a portion from the Claro's configuration file is copied:

    [common]
    master_passwd_file=/srv/claro/master_pwd
    nodes=mendieta[01-23]

    [ipmi]
    parallel=12
    suffix=-ipmi
    chassis=supermicro
    conmand=None



The lines starting with a semi-colon are commentaries and they're ignored.

`[common]` and `[ipmi]` indicate the begin of a section and its name.

The remaining lines contain properties. Every property has a name and a value,
delimited by an equals sign (=). The name appears to the left of the equals sign
and the value appears to the right. All properties listed after a section
declarotion are associated with that section.

The section `[common]` is common to all the plugins and then every plugin
can add a section with the name of the plugin.

Sometimes, we want to add specific values for different distros and in that case
we'll need to add the name of the plugin, a hyphen `-` followed by the name of
the distribution. For example, if we want to add different configurations
values for the plugin `repo` for centos6 and centos7, we'll need to add them
under the sections `[repo-centos6]` and `[repo-centos7]`.


# Plugins

## Plugin 'ipmi'

*claro ipmi* offers a simplified interface of ipmitool, an utility for controlling
IPMI-enabled devices. The username and password needed by ipmitool are handled
automatically.

Usernames and passwords are stored in a text file indicated in common sections under 
the property `master_passwd_file`. This plugin is expected to find the following 
values: 

    IMMUSER=ADMIN
    IMMPASSWORD=SOMEPASS710

    claro ipmi reset <hostlist>

    claro ipmi ssh <hostlist> <command>

Run a command through the SSH interface of the IMM

For the commands that allow to interact multiple nodes at the same time,
the command can be run in parallel using [--p=<level>].
The parallelism to use by default can be set in the configuration file
in the [ipmi] section with the paramenter "parallel". This value is
overridden by the input from the command line.

Furthermore, the <hostlist> can be replaced by the key word "nodes", defined
in the configuration file in the [common] section.



### Examples

This command will ping all hosts nodes in a cluster:

    # claro ipmi ping nodes

To check the status from node13:

    # claro ipmi status node13

Or also:

    # claro ipmi node13 status

And you can check the status of all the nodes using parallelism:

    # claro ipmi --p=16 status node[12-99]
